# iThesaurusChallenge
This code base was prepared as an job interview exercise for the employers review... 
I was given a starting point of an interface describing iThesaurus.  From there I had to implement a solution that contained implementations of the interface's methods.  I chose to include the repository pattern so that the backing data store for the thesaurus could be changed to 'anything'.  I included appropriate unit tests in the project and provided a sample console app demonstrating the usage of the implementation.
